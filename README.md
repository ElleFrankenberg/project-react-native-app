# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

The assignment was to build a mobile application with React Native.

## The problem

At first I wanted to choose the focus area: Sensors, to build a "ball in a hole" app. But I could not get it to work on my phone. I could see my app for only one second in my phone and then Expo Go crashed and the app disappeared. So I choose the focus area: API:s & sharing instead. The API I fetched my data from was https://docs.thecatapi.com to build a Cat application.

My idea was to have a home page with two buttons. One that was linked to a page where i fetched data from an API to show different random cat images when pressing a button. And one to a page with an other API where i fetched data to display information about different cat breeds. But I culdenÂ´t figure out how to get my API values in to a Select/Picker dropdown. I tryed so many ways and read so many articles but eventually (due to the lack of time) I hade to give up :(
So if I hade more time I would still sit by my computer trying to solve this...

This week was hard, but also a fun challenge! And IÂ´m happy with what i achived in this few days. I also think I have learned a lot from all the googeling.
